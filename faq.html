													<h2>3. What is the difference between WindNinja and WindWizard?</h2>

																<a href="http://www.firelab.org/project/windwizard">WindWizard</a> is no longer available.
									              There is now a conservation of mass and momentum solver in
									              WindNinja which replaces the functionality of WindWizard.
									              <br>
									              <p style="font-size:105%;">The physics in the WindWizard solver were based on
									                proprietary software that required users to purchase a license. Because this
									                severely hampered usability, WindWizard is no longer available.
									                Instead, WindNinja has been upgraded to include the advanced physics previously included in
									                WindWizard, but without the licensing fees. As of version 3.0, WindNinja includes an optional
									                momentum solver that replaces the functionality of WindWizard. There are now two options for the
									                solver (the number-crunching part of WindNinja): 1) conservation of mass and 2) conservation
									                of mass and momentum. The conservation of mass option is the native, fast-running solver used
									                in the early versions of WindNinja. The conservation of mass and momentum option is a second solver
									                based on the OpenFOAM toolkit. OpenFOAM is free, open-source software for computational fluid dynamics
                                                                                        (CFD) from <a href="http://openfoam.org">the OpenFOAM Foundation</a>.</p><br>
									              <p style="font-size:105%;">The major differences, from a user’s perspective, between the two solvers are:</p>
									              <br>
									              <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1) The conservation of mass solver runs much faster than the conservation of mass and momentum solver (less than a minute for conservation of mass compared to 10s of minutes (depending on simulation specifics) for conservation of mass and momentum).</p><br>
									              <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2) The conservation of mass solver's approximation of the momentum equation is simpler and, at times, less accurate than that of the conservation of mass and momentum solver. This is the main reason the conservation of mass solver runs so much faster than the conservation of mass and momentum.</p><br>
									              <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3) The conservation of mass simulations are normally less accurate during stronger winds on the lee sides of ridges and mountains where re-circulation eddies can occur.</p><br>
									              <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4) WindNinja has a feature that allows users to enter measured wind information at several locations to drive the flow. WindNinja will produce a wind field that matches the winds as these locations. This feature is not currently available for the conservation of mass and momentum solver.</p><br>

									            <p style="font-size:105%;">There are several ways to view WindNinja outputs.  Probably the most convenient way is to use Google Earth and WindNinja's KMZ output file (.kmz).  As of version 3.0, WindNinja can generate a GeoPDF output file (.pdf). GeoPDFs can be viewed in any PDF reader, but can also be viewed in GIS programs including the Avenza PDF Maps mobile application. Another way, if you have a FARSITE landscape file (.lcp), is to use FlamMap with WindNinja's fire behavior output files (.asc).  Last, you could use a GIS such as ArcView or ArcMap with WindNinja's shape file output files (.shp, .shx, .dbf).  Instructions for plotting wind vectors using ArcView and ArcMap can be found within the help menu of WindNinja.</p>

																First, the elevation file must be one of the allowable file
																formats (Arc/Info ASCII Raster (.asc), FARSITE landscape file (.tif/.lcp), GeoTiff (.tif),
																ERDAS IMAGINE (.img)).  Second, the elevation file
																must not have any areas without data (NO_DATA values).
																See WindNinja Tutorial 1 in the help menu for more information
																about common reasons for having NO_DATA values and ways to fix these problems.
																Third, elevation files must not be too large in extent.
																We generally recommend that elevation files should be less than 50x50 km
																(about 30x30 miles).  Fourth, elevation files must be in units of meters.
																 This means both the horizontal and vertical units.
																 Last, if WindNinja 2.3.0 or newer is used, it must be georeferenced
																 in a "north up" projected coordinate system. We recommend using the best-fit UTM projection. A "north up" projection is required
										    						because we use the standard meteorological convention for wind direction where a north wind is a wind from 0 degrees (e.g., north is "up").</p>

									        <div class="faq_answer_container">
									          <div class="faq_answer">
									            <p style="font-size:105%;">The DEM resolution is really not so much the issue; the issue is the computational resolution of the wind simulation.   WindNinja resamples the DEM to build the internal computational resolution, which is the resolution of the actual wind simulation.  This computational resolution is the limiting factor in simulations when it comes to computational time and computational memory (running out of computer RAM).  The choice of computational resolution should be such that the terrain is adequately resolved for the wind simulation, meaning that the scale of terrain that you want to resolve is resolved.  For example, if you want to resolve all terrain features of a certain size, say hills of horizontal size of around 100 meters, then the computational resolution should probably be at least 10 to 30 meters so that there are several cells on the 100 meter hills.  And so the computational resolution choice is probably really a function of the terrain.  "Smoother" terrains with large average distances between hills/ridges could use larger cell sizes than "rougher" terrain.
									<br><br>
									Through experience, we've found that 100 to 300 meter computational (mesh) resolutions are usually adequate for most terrains.  This can be obtained by choosing "fine" for mesh resolution and keeping the DEM extent to less than 40-50 km on a side.  The user can choose "custom" for resolution and manually enter a computational cell size in meters.  You could play around with a larger DEM (say 100 km by 100 km) and manually set the computational (mesh) resolution.  The limiting factor will be computer RAM, at some point you'll run out.</p>

									              <p style="font-size:105%;">Indeed we have. For an example and discussion, you could look at the images on pages 30-31 of <a href="http://www.firelab.org/document/forthofer-thesis">Jason Forthofer's master's thesis</a>.  Note that this terrain is fairly gentle though.  The appropriate grid resolution is dependent on the specific terrain and what winds you want to resolve. Probably one of the best things to do is to experiment with different computational (mesh) resolutions for your terrain to see how much difference there is (sensitivity).</p>

									              <div class="faq_answer">
									                <p style="font-size:105%;">As with most numerical models of this type, winds along the border of the modeling domain may have some error.  This is because, in reality, terrain features outside the modeling domain may affect the wind flow inside the domain.  But since these terrain features are not modeled, the simulation results do not reflect them.  There is a simple solution to deal with this problem.  Use an elevation file that is slightly larger than the area you want to model so there is a buffer around your desired area.  We recommend a 10-20% buffer size.</p>

									                  <p style="font-size:105%;">Because of how the conservation of mass solver simulates momentum, it cannot capture eddies (reversed flow) at all.  Instead you will just see very low wind speeds in these areas, but not reversed direction. The conservation of mass and momentum solver (available since version 3.0) will capture eddies in the flow field. We are in the process of evaluating the conservation of mass and momentum solver, including its ability to resolve lee-side eddies, against field observations in complex terrain.</p>

See <a href="https://weather.firelab.org/windninja/tutorials/WindNinja_tutorial4.pdf">Tutorial 4</a> for instructions on how to use wrfout files for initialization. Right now the NCEP model output we download from NOMADS and UCAR and WRF-ARW NetCDF output are the only model output formats that can be used to initialize WindNinja. We'd like to support additional models, but unfortunately, there are many formats that the weather model output is stored in. These formats differ not just in the file format (e.g., NetCDF, GRIB, etc.), but also in they way the time, geographic projection information, and output variables are stored and hanlded. This makes it very difficult to support all possible models, although we do hope to someday implement a method to allow initialization with arbitrary weather model formats.<br> 
                                                                                <br>
                                                                                For now, if you want to use an unsupported weather model format for initialization, you could consider converting your model output to the WRF-ARW NetCDF format. Other users have done this successfully. You can see an example converter script <a href="files/convert_CHM-GEM.py">here</a> (provided by <a href="http://chrismarsh.ca/">Chris Marsh</a>) and an example wrfout file <a href="https://ninjastorm.firelab.org/data/wrfout_d04_2010-09-05_120000.nc">here</a>. To mimic a WRF-ARW NetCDF output file, you'll need the following:<br>
                                                                                            <ol>
                                                                                                <li>There needs to be a global attribute "TITLE" that has "WRF" in it. For example, TITLE = " OUTPUT FROM WRF V3.2 MODEL" is what is in the example wrfout file. WindNinja only searches for the text "WRF" in the TITLE attribute though.</li><br>
                                                                                                <li>There needs to be a time variable. In the example wrfout file it is the first variable defined as: char Times(Time, DateStrLen). There also needs to be a dimension "Time" and "DateStrLen". In the example wrfout file, it looks like this:<br><br>
                                                                                            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">

                                                                                                  <li>Time = UNLIMITED ; // (24 currently)</li>
                                                                                                  <li>DateStrLen = 19 ;</li>
                                                                                            </ul>

                                                                                                <li>There needs to be a global attribute "MAP_PROJ" which defines the projection used for the WRF simulation. In the example wrfout file MAP_PROJ = 1 (which corresponds to LCC; 2 is Polar Stereographic, and 3 is Mercator). It's critical that you know what projection your simulation is in, otherwise the WindNinja initialization will not be correct (the predicted winds will not be located correctly in space).</li><br>
                                                                                           <li>The required variable names are U10 (u-component of the wind at 10 m), V10 (v-component of the wind at 10 m), T2 (temperature at 2 m), and QCLOUD (cloud water mixing ratio).</li>
                                                                                            </ol>

												<p style="font-size:105%;"><i>WindNinja only has built-in support for downloading current forecasts. What if I want to initialize with a forecast from the past (i.e., a past cast)?</i><br><br> WindNinja currently supports two formats for past casts: 1. WRF-ARW NetCDF files and 2. archived HRRR. See FAQ 17 for instructions on initializing WindNinja with WRF-ARW NetCDF output. To initialize with archived HRRR, you will need to obtain the relevant HRRR forecast file from <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/noaa-public/hrrr?pli=1">Google Cloud Platform</a>. There are a few different file formats on this server. You'll want to download the files that have "wrfprs" in the name. Right now these archived HRRR forecasts can only be used in the WindNinja command line interface (CLI). You can find instructions for the CLI <a href="https://weather.firelab.org/windninja/tutorials/CLI_instructions.pdf">here</a>. We will be adding support for download and initialization via the WindNinja GUI soon.<br>
