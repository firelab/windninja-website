        <!--Map Controls Section-->
        <section id="map-controls">
            <h2>Map Controls</h2>
            <p>WindNinja Mobile allows you to generate and view high definition wind model predictions in a 3D mapping environment. The mapping environment follows traditional map controls to allow you too quickly and easily become familiar with navigating around the map and adjusting your perspective.</p>
            <!--UI Controls-->
            <h3>User Interface Controls</h3>
            <p>WindNinja utilizes industry standard controls to help you navigate the map quickly.</p>
            <!--Search Bar-->
            <h4>Search Bar</h4>
            <p>The search bar is located at the top of the screen. It can be used to search for a specific location to help you narrow down your area of interest quicker. When you are creating or viewing a simulation the search bar is no longer available. While creating a simulation, the search bar switches to show you the size of the simulation domain. While viewing a simulation, the search bar is hidden to give you more screen real estate to view the simulation.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="img/search-bar.png" width="300" alt="Search bar that is located at the top of the map." />
            <p class="caption">Search bar that is located at the top of the map.</p>
            <!--Compass-->
            <h4>Compass</h4>
            <p>WindNinja includes a compass graphic, which appears in the top right corner of the map. When tapped, the compass animates the map back to a position with a bearing and tilt of zero (the default orientation). This returns the map to an over-the-top view, similar to that of traditional 2D mapping environments.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="img/compass.png" width="300" alt="Compass icon that appears in the top right corner of the map." />
            <p class="caption">Compass icon that appears in the top right corner of the map.</p>
            <!--MY Location-->
            <h4>My Location Button</h4>
            <p>The My Location Button is located in the bottom tab bar on the right-hand side. When tapped, this will zoom the map to your current location using your devices GPS.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="img/my-location.png" width="300" alt="My Location icon that appears in the bottom tool bar." />
            <p class="caption">My Location icon that appears in the bottom tool bar.</p>
            <h3>Map Gestures</h3>
            <p>Similar to the UI Controls, WindNinja utilizes standard map gestures to make navigating and controlling the map easier.</p>
            <!--Zoom Gestures-->
            <h4>Zoom Gestures</h4>
            <p>The map responds to a variety of gestures that can change the zoom level of the camera:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Double tap to increase the zoom level by 1 (zoom in). This will zoom in to the location you tapped.</li>
                <li>Two fingers tap to decrease the zoom level by 1 (zoom out).</li>
                <li>Two finger pinch/stretch</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="screenshot" src="gifs/zoom-gestures.gif" width="300" alt="Pinch/stretch to zoom in and out example. (Animated GIF)" />
            <p class="caption">Pinch/stretch to zoom in and out example. (Animated GIF)</p>
            <!--Scroll Gestures-->
            <h4>Scroll (pan) Gestures</h4>
            <p>You can scroll (pan) around the map by dragging the map with one finger. </p>
            <!--tilt Gestures-->
            <h4>Tilt Gestures</h4>
            <p>You can tilt the map (3D View) by placing two fingers on the screen and moving them down or up together to increase or decrease the tilt angle respectively.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="gifs/tilt-gestures.gif" width="300" alt="Tilt gesture example. (Animated GIF)" />
            <p class="caption">Tilt gesture example. (Animated GIF)</p>
            <!--Rotate Gestures-->
            <h4>Rotate Gestures</h4>
            <p>You can rotate the map by placing two fingers on the screen and applying a rotate/twisting motion. </p>

            <p>WindNinja allows you to create and view high resolution wind model simulations for an area of interest up to 70 square miles. You also have the ability to share and import simulations so with other WindNinja users through a unique identifier that is generated for each simulation.</p>
            <!--Creating Simulation-->
            <h3>Creating a Simulation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate (pinch/zoom/pan/search) to an area of interest on the map.</li>
                <li>On the map screen, tap the blue circle with the pen icon located in the bottom right corner.</li>
                <li>A rectangle green rectangle will appear on the map with circular vertices one each corner. This rectangle identifies the area that will be simulated. The search bar will transform into a label that identifies the size of the current simulation area. <span class="bold">You can simulate an area with a maximum size of 70 square miles.</span></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>To adjust the location of the simulation area, tap and hold on the plus icon in the middle of the rectangle until it turns blue. Once the rectangle has turned blue, you can drag the rectangle around on the map to reposition the simulation area.</li>
                    <li>To adjust the size of the simulation area, tap and hold on one of the circular vertices until the rectangle turns blue. Once the rectangle as turned blue, you can drag the corner of the rectangle to resize the simulation area.</li>
                    <li>A green box indicates that the simulation area is below the maximum allowed size of 70 square miles, while a red rectangle indicates that the simulation area is too large to simulate.</li>

                <li>Once submitted, your simulation will appear in the simulation list. This is where you will be able to see the status of your simulation(s) and download them locally to your device.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><mark>Please Note: Before you can view a simulation, you will have to download it locally to your device. This ensures that any simulations are downloaded locally to your device for offline and disconnected use.</mark></p>
            <!--Downloading & Viewing Simulations-->
            <h3>Downloading &amp; Viewing a Simulation</h3>
            <p>The simulation list is where you can select simulations to view and see the current status of your run simulations. This screen also gives you the ability to share, import and delete simulations.</p>
            <p><mark>Please Note: The simulation list only shows simulations that you have run on your device. You cannot view simulations that have been run by other WindNinja Mobile users, unless they are ones you have imported.</mark></p>
            <p>Simulations are color coded to indicate their status. The colors indicate the following statuses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Processing:</span> A red icon indicates that your simulation is still processing on the server and is not ready to be viewed.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Download:</span> A blue icon indicates that the simulation is complete and is ready for you to download the simulation to your device for viewing.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">View:</span> A green icon indicates that the simulation is complete and has been downloaded locally to your device for viewing.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Failed:</span> A grey icon with an X in it indicates that the simulation has failed.</li>
            </ul>
            <!--Selecting a Simulation-->
